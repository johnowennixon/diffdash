Configuration file for the dependency checker tool that identifies unused dependencies in the project. Specifies packages to be ignored during dependency checking, including `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` which is used by ESLint but might not be directly imported in code, and `rimraf` which is a cross-platform file deletion utility likely used in scripts. These exceptions prevent false positives when analyzing project dependencies.
