Configuration file for pnpm workspaces that defines settings for managing multiple packages in a monorepo. Specifies which dependencies should only be built (not linked) during development, including packages like `@biomejs/biome` and `protobufjs`. Also defines global dependency overrides to ensure `whatwg-url` uses version 14.0.0 or newer across the workspace, helping prevent compatibility issues when packages have conflicting dependency requirements.
