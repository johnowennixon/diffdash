Configuration file for the Markdown linter tool that enforces consistent formatting in Markdown documents. Disables line length restrictions to allow flexibility in writing documentation. Specifies that unordered lists should use asterisks (*) as bullet points instead of other symbols. Configures the linter to respect .gitignore patterns and suppress messages about found files, keeping the output focused on actual linting issues.
