Provides configuration management for the DiffDash application by defining a `DiffDashConfig` interface and a `get_config()` function that processes parsed command-line arguments. The module transforms raw argument data into a structured configuration object that includes workflow settings, automation flags, LLM configuration, and debug options. It also handles LLM model selection logic, including fallback model usage and debug channel configuration for monitoring AI interactions.
