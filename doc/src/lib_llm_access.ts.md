This module provides utilities for determining LLM model availability and obtaining access credentials for language model interactions. It includes functions to check if a model is available based on API key presence and exclusion filters, and to get the appropriate access configuration including model code, provider, and API key. The module handles both direct provider access and OpenRouter routing, with fallback logic to ensure models can be accessed through available credentials.
