This module provides LLM model configuration specific to the Diffdash tool, which is used for generating commit messages. It defines a curated list of supported language models including GPT, Claude, Gemini, and other providers, with `gpt-4.1-mini` as the default model and `claude-3.5-haiku` as fallback. The module exports model details, choices for command-line selection, and allows overriding the default model via the `DIFFDASH_LLM_MODEL` environment variable.
