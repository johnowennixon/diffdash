Lock file for the pnpm package manager that records the exact version of every installed dependency. Ensures reproducible builds by specifying precise dependency versions and their dependency tree. This large file maintains information about direct dependencies, transitive dependencies, and any overrides needed for compatibility. When package.json changes, this file is updated automatically to ensure consistent installations across different development environments.
