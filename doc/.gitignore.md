Configuration file for Git that specifies which files and directories should be excluded from version control. Excludes build artifacts in the `dist` and `out` directories, dependency files in `node_modules`, local Claude AI settings, ESLint cache files, and any test files matching the pattern `test.*`. The file also prevents accidental inclusion of sensitive information by ignoring `.npm.token` which likely contains private access credentials.
