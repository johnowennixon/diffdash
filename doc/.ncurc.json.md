Configuration file for npm-check-updates (ncu), a tool that helps upgrade package.json dependencies to their latest versions. Contains an empty `reject` array, indicating that no packages are excluded from version updates. This allows all dependencies to be considered for upgrades when running the dependency update tool, making it easier to keep the project dependencies current.
