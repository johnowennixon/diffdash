Git configuration file that specifies custom attributes for matching paths in the repository. Configures `package-lock.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` files with the `-diff` attribute, which instructs Git not to show differences for these files in normal diff output. This setting is used for lock files which are automatically generated and typically contain large, complex changes that would clutter diff views.
