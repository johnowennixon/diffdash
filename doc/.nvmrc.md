Configuration file for Node Version Manager (nvm) that specifies Node.js version 24 as the required runtime for this project. When developers use nvm and enter the project directory, this file allows their environment to automatically switch to the correct Node.js version. Works similarly to .node-version but specifically for the nvm tool, providing consistent JavaScript runtime across different development environments.
