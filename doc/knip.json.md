Configuration file for the Knip tool which analyzes JavaScript and TypeScript projects to find unused code. Defines entry points as specific TypeScript files in the src directory with patterns like `cg_*.ts` and `jn_*.ts`. Ignores specific library files that might be used dynamically or are kept for reference, and excludes certain dependencies and binary files from analysis. Helps maintain a clean codebase by identifying dead code that can be safely removed.
