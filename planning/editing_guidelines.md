# Editing Guidelines

## Completion checklist
- Before considering any change as complete, you must run a lint and build, and fix any errors

## Available scripts and commands
- To lint the code, run `pnpm run lint`
- To build the code, run `pnpm run build`
- If you need to fix formatting issues, run `pnpm run fix:biome`

## Installing software
- Please do not install NPM packages yourself - just ask for this to be done for you
- Under no circumstances should you install system packages yourself - if you want this done then we can discuss it
