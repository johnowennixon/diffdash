Please edit the documentation file `planning/source_files.md`.

List all source files in the codebase (in the `src` directory).

For any that are not already documented, please read the file so see how it works, and add a section to the documentation. Document with a paragraph of approximately three sentences. If you do not understand a file, just say so. Add new documentation under the appropriate groups. Maintain lists of files in alphabetical order within its group.

For all files that are documented, check they are still in the codebase. If they are not, please remove them from the documentation.
